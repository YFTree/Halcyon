# Ella Music

A clean local music player built with Jetpack Compose, Miuix, and Media3, with UI and interaction details tuned for a MIUI/HyperOS-style experience.

Chinese documentation: [README.md](README.md)

## Features

- Local music scanning, search, playback, and folder browsing
- Home, album, and folder search, sorting, fast indexing, and multi-select management
- CJK titles participate in A-Z sorting through Latinized sort keys, with cached keys to reduce home-screen stalls
- Album pages, artist pages, song lists, current queue, mini player, and immersive now-playing screen
- WebDAV library configuration, connection testing, remote directory browsing, and remote audio playback
- WebDAV paths support Chinese characters, spaces, and encoded characters, with last-path restoration and cached folder results
- LX Music API source import from URLs or local JS files, with online search, playback, and downloads to `Music/Ella/`
- Online artwork display and Kuwo lyric fetching for online music
- Library analytics for format distribution, quality distribution, play-count ranking, and listen-time ranking
- LRC / enhanced LRC / TTML parsing with word-level lyrics, translations, background vocals, and TTML duet layout
- External LRC and embedded lyric reading, including common Chinese lyric encoding fallbacks
- Custom lyric-page fonts from system-font previews or imported TTF / OTF / TTC font files in Settings
- Lyricon provider support and AOSP ticker lyric notifications
- WAV, FLAC, M4A, OGG, OPUS, and other audio tag reading
- FFmpeg extension decoder for ALAC / M4A compatibility
- ReplayGain volume normalization
- Miuix settings, theme switching, and default floating bottom navigation

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella.git
cd Ella
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Release builds first read `RELEASE_STORE_FILE`, `RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`, `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`, and `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` from the environment. If they are not set, the project-root `release.jks` is used with the default alias `release`.

Prebuilt FFmpeg static libraries are stored in `ffmpeg-decoder/src/main/jni/ffmpeg/android-libs`. To rebuild them on Windows, run:

```powershell
.\build_ffmpeg.ps1
```

The script builds FFmpeg through WSL with the Linux Android NDK.
